2014-03-09 22:30:39	fendur	Pyuruku: yep. seems like it should if 12 is the magic number for all columns.
2014-03-09 22:30:50	Pyuruku	yay
2014-03-09 22:31:21	Pyuruku	just trying to calculate the probability that the true mean falls within a list of confidence intervals is all
2014-03-09 22:31:35	fendur	Pyuruku: im not sure you should have used "&&" though.
2014-03-09 22:32:12	fendur	do you want to know if 12 falls within ALL bounds? Or do you what to know which bounds in falls within?
2014-03-09 22:32:26	Pyuruku	which bounds it falls within
2014-03-09 22:32:40	lseactuary	can you tell me how i get the intercept - ill just copy/paste manually
2014-03-09 22:32:41	fendur	did you get a single result with your code? Or a vector?
2014-03-09 22:32:49	Pyuruku	vector
2014-03-09 22:33:01	fendur	Oh. Then I'm probably just wrong.
2014-03-09 22:33:09	Pyuruku	although looking at the values, 12 fell within all of them

2014-03-09 22:35:19	fendur	the double checks for ALL
2014-03-09 22:35:22	fendur	data[1,] < 12 & data[2,] > 12

2014-03-09 22:35:24	fendur	single check each
2014-03-09 22:35:42	fendur	or 
2014-03-09 22:35:56	fendur	damnit. Maybe double checks only the first? I'm not exactly sure. But the latter seems like what you want.
2014-03-09 22:36:38	fendur	Yeah. && checks just the first bound not all of them. Use the latter suggestion with only one &
2014-03-09 22:36:45	Pyuruku	okay, thanks for catching that
2014-03-09 22:37:09	lseactuary	fendur - what do i do please :S
2014-03-09 22:37:13	fendur	and do not wrap data[ ] around the whole thing.
2014-03-09 22:37:48	fendur	lseactuary: I can't communicate with you. I'm giving up.
2014-03-09 22:37:52	lseactuary	:(

2014-03-09 22:39:49	lseactuary	sorry :S
2014-03-09 22:42:33	Pyuruku	fendur seems all is going well, with 1000 confidence intervals of a theoretical 95% confidence level, I get 0.938 :) Thanks!
