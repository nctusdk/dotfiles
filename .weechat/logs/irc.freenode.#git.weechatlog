2014-03-09 22:15:10	@gitinfo	git does not support explicitly file renaming - the 'git mv' command is shorthand for 'git rm --cached; mv; git add'. All "rename" statistics are generated at runtime when examining history with git-log. See the -M option in the git-log manpage for more info. Also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/27/focus=217 and `diff.renames = true`  in man git-config
2014-03-09 22:15:10	+skorgon	dglambert: a rename should not conflict, IMHO. the other side must have edited the file as well
